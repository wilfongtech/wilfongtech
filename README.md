## Greetings 👋

## 🚀 Going beyond Helpdesk!
I am actively transitioning from foundational support into specialized engineering roles. My home lab serves as a sandbox for learning the "Next Level" of IT infrastructure:

- 🏗️ **Systems Architecture:** Designing virtualized environments using Proxmox VMs, Containers, and Podman to continually educate myself on technology. 
- 🤖 **DevOps & Automation:** Moving away from manual fixes by using Bash scripting and Systemd to create "Infrastructure as Code" (IaC) environments.
- 🐧 **Linux Engineering:** Deep-diving into Linux-based ecosystems to learn, adapt, and master a skillset I didn't previously have.
- 🕸️ **Network Engineering:** Utilizing Proxmox and Unifi, I have learned about networking from a pragmatic point of view. 

### 🛠️ What I'm working on
- **Creating a all in one script to launch Minecraft Servers in Ubuntu Server
- **Managing Proxmox environments in my homelab
- **Creating a Podman setup to also learn about containerization
- **Diving into GO as a programming language
- **Learning to use AI not as a mean to vibecode, but as an accelarator of gathering knowledge
